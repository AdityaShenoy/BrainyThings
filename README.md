# Brainy_Things

A region where you can learn any brain related things. These include programming, mathematics tricks, etc.

The web animations that will be created will be recorded using a screen recorder and will be uploaded to my YouTube channel.

Current working version is version 5

1st version was an attempt to create a website.
2nd version was an attempt to create a more interactive website.
In 3rd to 5th version, we write animations in csv file and convert it programmatically to css animations.
